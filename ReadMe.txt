1."Original_Exercises.zip" stores the original exercises used in experiments.
2."New_Exercises.zip" stores the newly generated exercises. Open the "index. html" under each subfolder in the browser to view the details of the exercises.
3. "Original_Exercises.csv" records the information of original exercises. The meaning of its columns：
     Eid: The id of original exercises.
     Identity: The Point geometry identities of original exercises.
4. "New_Exercises.csv" records the information of the  newly generated exercises. The meaning of its columns：
     Eid: The id of original exercises.
     Id: The id of newly generated exercises.
     Value_1 and Value_2: Expert evaluation results. "0" means the exercise can be used in teaching, while "1" means the exercise  cannot be used in teaching.
     Identity: The Point geometry identities of newly generated exercises.
